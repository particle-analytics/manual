> NOTE:
> * The recommended view mode for large models is Internal Texture.
> The Nice view mode should be reserved for small models or special cases due to the high computational cost involved in the rendering.
> 
> * When Nice view mode is activated, the render mode can be changed in: `Menu > View > Render`, or with the Mouse Menu (right button) and Render.
